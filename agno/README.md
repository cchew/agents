*What is a good prompt for an LLM to review a document and provide comments*

A good prompt for an LLM to review a document and provide comments should be:

1. **Clear and specific** about the type of feedback you want.
2. **Contextual** about the purpose or audience of the document.
3. **Structured** to guide the LLM's response format.

Here’s a strong general-purpose prompt you can adapt:

---

**Prompt:**

> Please review the following document and provide constructive comments. Focus on clarity, coherence, tone, grammar, and overall structure. Highlight areas that could be improved or clarified, and suggest specific edits where appropriate. The document is intended for [insert audience or purpose, e.g., "a professional business report," "a college admissions essay," etc.].  
>  
> Return your comments as either in-line suggestions or a list of detailed notes categorized by paragraph or section.

---

**Example with a little more structure:**

> Review the document below and provide feedback in the following categories:
> 1. **Clarity** – Are the ideas clearly expressed?
> 2. **Coherence** – Do the paragraphs flow logically?
> 3. **Grammar/Spelling** – Note any errors.
> 4. **Tone/Style** – Is the tone appropriate for the intended audience?
> 5. **Suggestions** – Recommend specific edits to improve readability and impact.
>  
> Document:  
> [Insert document text here]
